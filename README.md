The Comparison of Search-Based and Reinforcement Learning Agents: The Game of Snake

  This project covers the comparison of a search-based agent(SBA) (using the A* algorithm) and a reinforcement learning agent(RLA), which uses adaptive learning. 
  This project allows for the user to gain a better understanding of the advantages and disadvantages of using a SBA or RLA in order to autonomously run the game of Snake in real-time  
  It is recommended that anyone using this code have all imported libraries already installed on the IDE to prevent any issues with running the code.
